        (read: free!) service to help restaurant and food service owners and operators
        "Buy Smarter" by using technology to analyze invoice detail data to identify
        opportunities and trends in the costs of the things you buy the most. Members
        like you will always have access to this free service simply for providing us
        with access to your purchasing data – and thatÕs our commitment to you. By
