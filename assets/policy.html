      <h3>5. NAVIGATIONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <h3>5.1. Cookies</h3>

      <p>
We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Subscription Service, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.
</p>
<p>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Subscription Service or Websites you visit. Main Street Genome keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within Main Street Genome, in order to determine what portion of the Subscription Service is the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within Main Street Genome to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
</p>

      <h3>5.2. Log Files</h3>

      <p>
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Main Street Genome for the operation of the Subscription Service, to maintain quality of the Subscription Service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>

      <p>
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting-Out and Unsubscribing”.
      </p>

      <h3>5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers</h3>

      <p>
Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Subscription Service. Main Street Genome does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.
      </p>

      <h3>5.5. Single Sign-On</h3>

      <p>
You can log in to our site using a Single Sign-on (SSO) service like your Google account. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Such services may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
      </p>

      <h3>5.6. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies</h3>

      <p>
The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as “Flash cookies.” Main Street Genome does not use Flash cookies. However, our Clients of our software platform may create pages on the Main Street Genome platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies. Our Terms of Service requires our Clients to inform you about their use of Flash cookies. Main Street Genome does not have access or control over our Clients’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly. Similarly, our Clients may create pages on the Main Street Genome platform that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons The use of these technologies by our Clients is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.
      </p>

      <h3>5.7. Advertising</h3>

      <p>
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
      </p>

      <h3>5.8. Third Party Tracking Technologies</h3>

      <p>
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies
      </p>
